   There will be a public beta with freely distributed test-CPEP after the Alpha test.
1. Communication is encouraged, share your progress / user experience,
   and we can improve on the human part too. Testing is not only about software bugs.

## Payouts

We will do the payout once the PEP token is created.

In addition to per issue rewards, each tester that has done something will receive 100 PEP. 

Also there is a reward of 250 PEP for the person who has breeded the most during the alpha.

The alpha will run until Saturday, and may be restarted in case of severe issues that need a contract re-deploy.
In this case, we will put out a notice and keep track of individual bounty progress during the transition.
